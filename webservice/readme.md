### Webservice in Kotlin ###

This is the simplest kotlin project that will compile a webservice that can be
deployed into an application server.

For this example, you have to use a container that is servlet spec 3.+.

Simply drop the generated war into the deployment directory. For tomcat, that
would be /webapps.
